This repository holds research level codes, some from Numerical
Recipes, that were used to invert for fault sliprate and locking depth
in


Platt, J. P. and Becker, T. W.: Where is the real transform boundary
in California? Geochem., Geophys., Geosys., 11, Q06013,
doi:10.1029/2010GC003060, 2010.

The code fragments should be complete but might not work out of the box. 

Compilation (see makefile) requires SLATEC. 

There are a couple of driver routines that illustrate how the invert code can be used. 

This is a >10 year old research code that has not been comprehensively tested for applications outside the speciific data used in this paper, 
and there is no additional documentation.
